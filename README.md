Project goal was to scrape data from ESPN and the US Census Beraeau of Statistics to find any causality between NFL player positions (QB, LB, RB) and the median income (annual, in USD) of their hometowns. Result was my team of 4 people and I did not find any causality between hometown income and position, however hometown is one factor to consider for player opportunities at reacing the NFL. A 4-month project & I had lots of fun doing it.
